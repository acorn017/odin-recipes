            Preheat the oven to 350*F (175*C)
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chicken, beans, corn, cream of chicken soup,

        <li>
            Spread out 1/3 of the chips on the bottom of a 9x13 inch rectangular
            casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the chicken mixture. Top chicken mixture with
            1/3 of shredded cheddar cheese. Repeat the layer. Top the 2nd layer with remaining
